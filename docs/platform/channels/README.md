Modyo Channels provides extensive access to the base code of every channel through a set of templates, giving developers complete control of every detail of a user's digital experiences, published through an integrated version control system.

Modyo Channels has editable design templates that make it easy to reuse code.

Modyo Channels also has a templating system based on [Liquid Markup](/platform/channels/liquid-markup.html) that allows for dynamic interpolation of information which is efficiently processed from the server side.

### Main functionalities

- [Site management](/platform/channels/sites.html) to organize digital channels.
- [Dynamic pages](/platform/channels/pages.html) to define the structure of each site and add content to it.
- [Widgets](/platform/channels/widgets.html) to create reusable components using technologies such as Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- [Templates](/platform/channels/templates.html) to organize the overall structure of a site and its design system.
