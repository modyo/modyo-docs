# Navigation

Navigation is the fastest way to put together a list of elements to give your users easy access to the key points of your site.

![Navigation builder](/assets/img/platform/navigation-builder.png)

In this section you will find a nested list of elements, which correspond to the elements that will appear on the site when using the <span v-pre> `{% menu%}` </span> tag in the [template builder section](/platform/channels/templates.html).

The builder menu only allows two levels of depth, so you can have a main list, and sub elements in each of the main items. You will not be able to nest other elements within the nested elements.

At the top of the view, you will find the publication status of the menu:

- **Published**: You will see this status after you have made a publication and when the editable and published versions are the same.
- **Pending changes**: You will see this status if there is already a published version, but there are pending changes to be published in your editable version.
- **In review**: You will see this status when [team review](/platform/core/key-concepts.html) is enabled and the editable version has been submitted for review.
- **Approved**: You will see this status when [team review](/platform/core/key-concepts.html) is enabled and if the item review conditions were met. If you are in this state, your changes are ready to be published.

In the upper right, you will find the latest publication date and the available actions:

By default you will start comparing the published version with the editable version, but by using the version selectors, you can also compare previous versions as well.

::: tip Tip
Every time you publish and replace the current version, the replaced version becomes a "backup" or previous version. By default, up to 20 backups are saved, and can be compared and restored through the "rollback" feature. For more information on versioning, check out the [versioning](/platform/core/key-concepts.html#versioning) section.

You can add comments by submitting them at the bottom of the sidebar. Next to each activity, you can click on "Show details" to show the complete information of that particular activity log.

**Main actions**

- **Save**: Saves all menu changes.
- **Send to review**: Changes the menu status to "In review". In this state you can continue making changes, but each change alerts assigned reviewers via email.
- **Reject**: Returns to the "Pending changes" state, and notifies reviewers that the item was rejected.
- **Publish**: Once the changes are approved, you can go to the [publish view](/platform/channels/sites.html#review-and-joint-publication) to review and publish changes across the site.

In the right side section, you will see a bar that changes according to the item selected in the main area. In this section are the following options:

- **Name**: Name of the item as it appears on the site.
- **Associated Layout Page**: Directly associate a page to this menu item with a custom URL.
- **URL**: If you chose a custom URL in the "Associated Layout Page", you can specify the URL of this menu item.
- **Open in new tab**: Enable this option to open a the menu item link in a new tab. Adds the `target='blank'` attribute to the menu item's HTML.
- **Private**: Makes the selected item appear visible only when the user has an active session on the site.
- **Enable targeting**: If the previous option is enabled, you can also target this element, so that only those users in the specified targets will see this menu item.
