## Structure

Modyo also allows you to easily manage an ecommerce, organizing and centralizing orders, as well as simplifying the insertion of payment methods.

For this, there are two options that can be seen from the same sidebar:

## Commerce Settings

The configuration will allow to shape the commerce in all technical aspects, allowing to adjust default values and standardize them throughout the site

### General

In this section we can configure the most general data that give life to commerce, as is the case with the currency format.

In addition, it is allowed to activate the sending of an automatic email when the user pays his order, in the form of a receipt.

For this receipt, it is essential to adapt it to our commerce, so it is essential that the code that is implemented as a template is correctly aligned with the user order data that the platform will write automatically.

### Payment Methods

Modyo allows you to insert several forms of payment, which can make the operation of any company and customer more comfortable.

Currently, the payment methods compatible with Modyo are:

- Oneclick
- Webpay
- Khipu
- PayU
- PayU PSE
- TigoMoney
- PayMe
- Credomatic
- Bancard

Remember that for each of these forms of payment, you need permits and credentials to operate. Contact the representatives of each company to obtain them.
