# Realms

Realms are groups of users with similar characteristics that are governed by the same configuration. Realms are especially useful when you have different user groups for sites of the same account that are not directly related, or also, to have a test site with test users without affecting the group of productive users.

Each realm has its own configuration for login, registration, integrations, forms, targets and messaging, so you must take into consideration when creating any of these elements in a realm that it will only affect the users of that realm and will have no effect on users of another realm.

# Users

The Users section is where you can view and update users, or customers, that interact with your digital channels or receive messages through your campaigns through the Modyo platform. Users in the Customers section of your platform either registered through a site or application in Modyo Channels, responded to a form, or were imported directly into the platform manually or via the API.

### About the interface

In the main view, we can see a list of all registered users within the platform, paginated with 30 users per page.

Along the top of the list are filters that allow you to refine the list of users by the following attributes:
- Status: Filter by active and inactive users.
- Verification: Filter by users who have (or have not) confirmed their data within the platform.
- Targets: Filter by users that match certain [Targets](/platform/customers/targets.html).
- Advanced filters: Filter by users who match specific filters based on data in their user profiles, e.g. birth date, or custom field value.
- Search: Filter by user name, last name, email, or username.

The Advanced Filters option opens a window which allows you to filter users by specific attributes, such as their age, or by data in a custom field. When adding a new advanced filter, the number of users that match the filter criteria appears automatically in the lower left of the window, next to the button to clear the filters. If you want to see the list of these filtered users, click on the **Apply** button.

::: tip Tip
Next to the Apply button, there is the **Save as Target** button. This saves the filters you applied in a new Target. Give your new target a title and description. Later you can find it in the [Targets](/platform/customers/targets.html) section.
:::

You can sort users by ascending or descending order by the following values:
- Name: User Name
- Sign Up Date: Date and time of registration in the platform.
- Last Login: Most recent date and time a user logged into the platform.
- Logins Count: Number of times a user has logged into the platform.


### Add a user

To add a new user, you must click on the **+ New** button at the top right of the screen.

A selector will open that shows the two possible ways to create users in the system: manually or by importing them from a \*.CSV file. The second option allows us to import multiple users simultaneously.

When you select "Add User", the platform will ask you to complete the following fields:

- First Name: Legal name of the user. **Required**
- Last Name: Last name of the user.
- Second Last Name: user's second last name (optional).
- User Name: Name within the platform **Required**.
- Email: User email **Required**.
- Password: Password for the user to enter the platform. The password must be at least 8 characters. **Required**.
- Password confirmation: Input the same password to confirm.
- Tags: Tags that serve to identify the user.

::: tip Tip
To send the password to the user's email, check the box under the password field. When saving, an email with the password will be sent to the user. They can change this password later.
:::

The available fields may be more than those listed above, depending on the configuration on the platform and how many user custom fields are enabled in the account. You can learn more about this in the [Customers Configuration](/platform/customers/realms.html#customers-configuration) section.

### Import users

The second option to add new users is the "Import Users" option. Clicking this opens a User import view that lists all previous imports, if any. This list can be sorted by file name, import status, or date and time of import. You can search for import files by name in the search bar.

To make a new import, click on the upper right **+ Import** button. This opens a window where we can select and upload a local \*.CSV file that has a list of users and their attributes. It is important to check the box that indicates whether the file contains column headers or names, otherwise the headers themselves will be registered as a new user. Click **Accept** when ready.

From here, you can see the main import view. On the left, a list with three columns appears, with the first column containing the column name, the second containing some examples of the data, and allows for mapping options. Use these mapping options to assign imported values to user attributes such as first name, last name, email, etc.

::: tip Tip
The minimum attributes required to import a user are their first name (not to be confused with username) and their email address.
:::

On the right are the main import settings. Here you can set the file encoding and separator value (which by default is a comma). Below it is a box indicating if you've mapped the two required fields (name and email). The button for **Begin import** is enabled once you map these fields. Finally, there are four main import options:

- Activate user account
- Send notification email (customizable in [emails](/platform/customers/realms.html#emails))
- Add users to sites
- Update existing users (in case they are already registered on the platform)

Clicking the **Start import** button at the top returns you to the main import view, and the first record in the table will be your import in process. There you can check the progress in the **Status** column.

In addition, you can add any required custom fields. These can be configured in [Custom Fields](/platform/customers/realms.html#custom-fields), which are found in the [Customer Configuration section](/platform/customers/realms.html#customer-configuration).


### Users Tab

Clicking any user from the main list opens their profile. In each profile is the following information:

- User avatar (if one has been uploaded)
- Status within the platform: active or inactive.
- Signup Date
- Last Login
- Logins Count (number of sessions)
- User verification status
- Targets

In the main section to the right are the following tabs:

- Activity
- Responses
- Notes (to provide notes about this user in their profile, visible only to administrators)

#### Activity

In this section you will see a record of all the actions that the user has performed within the platform.

It should be noted that it is not a follow-up to the navigation of a user within the platform, but rather of the main interactions that it carries out within it. These records cannot be deleted or edited by administrators.

#### Form responses

This section shows you all the forms that the user has filled out within the platform. When you click on any of them, it takes you to see the answers of the user in said form. If you want to know more about the forms, go to the [Forms](/platform/customers/forms.html) section.

#### Notes

In this section you can add personalized notes about users, only administrators can add, view and delete them.

#### Additional options

In the upper right section you will find additional options with which you can disable and delete users:

* **Edit**: Opens the user edit modal. If you want to add more fileds to a user go to [Custom Fields](/platform/customers/realms.html#custom-fields).
* **Disable**: You can disable users and prevent them from logging in.
* **Delete**: Once a user is deactivated, you can delete that user. This action can be executed by team members who are administrators of the account and also each user can delete their account from the additional options in their profile.

::: tip Tip
When modifying a user, you may change the list of Targets to which they belong.

## Realm Settings

In this section we can configure the interaction between users and the Modyo platform itself (outside of Channels). Some configurations are focused on the look and feel, such as color selection or email templates, while others are focused on registration, access control, and personalization. In particular, registration and access control are essential for the proper functioning of the platform, so it is important to be cautious when modifying configurations in this section.

### General

Here you can configure general aspects of the realm, such as:

- **Name**.
- **Identifier**: Allows you to modify the url for profile, login, registration and password recovery views for the realm.
- **Enable/disable credentials**: Allows you to disable Modyo credentials in this realm.
- **Modify user account activation type**:
  - Direct: Users who register will be able to log in directly.
  - Activation email: Users who register will have to activate their account via a link sent to their email in order to log in.
  - Moderated: Users who register must wait for a Modyo administrator to activate their account before they can log in.
  - Disabled: No new users can be registered in the realm. Already registered and activated users will be able to log in without any problems.
- **Additional attributes for the registration form**:
  - Enable second last name
  - Make second last name required
  - Enable email confirmation: Enable an extra email field that the user must fill in and must match the primary email field in order for the user to register.
  - Enable user avatar
  - Enable date of birth
  - Enable gender
- **Delete realm**: Enables the complete deletion of the realm. This is a background process, so you may not see the realm disappear immediately after executing the action. In order to delete the realm, you must type the full name of the realm to confirm the action.

:::danger Danger
When disabling the realm's Modyo credentials, you must make sure that you have an identity provider configured for this realm, otherwise users will not be able to log in.
:::

### Appearance

This section will allow you to modify some visual aspects of the registration, login and profile views for the users in the realm.

#### Primary Color

The primary color is the one shown in the main buttons of the session management, such as entry, registration, password modifications or other attributes. To modify it, enter the HEX Code of the color you want and click on the **Save** button at the top of the screen.

#### Show logo

This option allows you to display the logo configured for the account in the session views, which will be displayed on the respective forms of those views. To change the logo, you must access the [Modyo Interface](/platform/core/the-modyo-interface.html).

#### Customize with CSS

If you want to have custom CSS in the session views, add it to the editor and click on the **Save** button.

It is common to have linked files in the Custom CSS. To link a file, click the button above the editor. This opens the [Asset Manager](/platform/content/asset-manager.html), where you can search for and copy the links of any files you need (by clicking the copy icon) to paste into the editor.

::: tip Tip
If you have problems with keyboard codes when you are editing the CSS, you can click on the keyboard icon above the editor. This will display a series of button shortcuts that will allow you to easily handle editing.
:::

### Emails

Modyo allows you to configure the sender and appearance of the emails that will be sent to users in the realm.

To adjust the address that will appear as the sender that will send your mail, you just have to enter it in the "Default mail" field and click on the **Save** button.

What this section allows is to enable, disable and customize the sending of automatic emails after specific interactions made by users, the emails are as follows:

- Activation email: Sent once a user registration is completed, so that it confirms your data.
- Imported user: Sent once the user was imported
- Welcome email: Sent after completing a user registration at a specific site.
- Added by administrator: Sent once the administrator created the user manually.
- Password recovery: Sent when the user requested to recover their password.
- Confirmation: Sent once the user was confirmed and activated.
- Waiting for approval: Sent once the user has been confirmed, but you must wait for manual activation from an administrator.
- Custom footer: Custom footer for all the emails described above.

To enable or disable the sending of these emails, we just have to click on the **Enabled/Disabled** button next to each function and click on the **Save** button.

#### Custom emails

The styles of the platform emails that we send can also be customized. To do this, we must have the HTML code that we want to include in them.

When you click to enable each of the emails, it will show a default editor in which we can paste our code.

:::danger Danger
It is essential that each email includes the customizable codes that allow the platform to include the random data of the user requesting the mail.

To do this, we must insert attributes in the code under the editor, and we can easily copy and paste to locate them in the part we need.
:::

Each time a code change is made, click on the **Save** button at the top of the screen.

### Identity providers

To simplify logging into the platform, it is possible to configure your login through the APIs of certain services that allow universal logins.

The services compatible with logging into Modyo are:

- Facebook
- Google
- LDAP
- SAML
- Oauth2
- OpenID Connect

It is necessary to have the correct configuration of the associated services to connect them with Modyo. Make sure all required fields are complete. For more information on integrations, go to the [Platform Integrations section](/platform/core/integrations)

### Team members

To organize the work, Modyo allows you to select the team members who will work in each realm and thus control access to the different aspects of the realm.

To add a user to the realm, select the primary button **+ New** in the top right corner of the page. In the modal select an administrator and assign a role, then press **Add** to make that administrator part of the realm team.

You can modify the role of any of the associated administrators by clicking on their name. A modal will pop up, where you can select the new role. Press **Save** to confirm the change.

If you want to remove an administrator from the realm, select the person using the checks to the left of their name, and then click on the **Delete** button at the bottom of the list.

The available roles are:

- **User**: Can add users or create, submit to review and review campaigns, forms and targets.
- **Admin**: Can access all the settings and sections of the realm, add and delete users and team members, as well as delete the realm.

### Custom Fields

From here you can create custom fields that help identify the user's profile. Therefore, it is essential that these are correctly identified for their best use.

The types of **Custom Fields** that you can add are:

- Checkbox
- Date
- Dropdown (drop-down list)
- Paragraph
- Number
- Choice
- Single Text Line

You can drag the **Custom Fields** to order them. Note that this is the order in which the fields will appear in the editing views and in the users profile.

All **Custom Fields** have certain standard properties:

- **Must be a unique response**: It implies that the value must be unique for each user, preventing another equal value from being saved.
- **This is a required field**: It implies that this value must be filled in when a user is modified or created, so that a user cannot be modified if this field does not have an associated value. In the event that the field is also visible and editable by users, this fields will appear on the registration form and will be required to create new users.
- **Visible to front end users**: It implies that it will be visible in the profile view.
- **Editable by front end users**: It implies that if it is visible, in addition, the user can modify its value.
- **Searchable by admins**: It implies that this value will be indexed and users can be found when searched in the users index for the value of that field.

In addition to the above, **Custom Fields** may be enabled or disabled. If enabled, then they can be used by administrators and depending on their configuration, they will be available to users. If a **Custom Field** is disabled, then it will not appear on any form, but its values will remain saved.

::: danger Danger
When a **Custom Field** is disabled, it can be deleted. By deleting a **Custom Field**, you permanently delete all the values that users had for that **Custom Field**.
:::

::: tip Tip
Apart from being able to save specific data in user profiles, filters for the [Targets](/platform/customers/targets.html) can be created using custom field data, allowing users to be segmented by customizable values.
