# Categories

Categories allow you to organize the content you publish by applying a structure based on the type of content they contain, so it is useful if we need to make directories of specific areas of knowledge.

## Create a Category

To create a category, click on the top button on the screen. There you must assign a Title and a Route to the category.

This step also serves to create subcategories. To do them, the same steps must be done but the corresponding Parent Category assigned.
