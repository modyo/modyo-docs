# Modyo Content

Modyo Content is an application that makes it possible to create dynamic content repositories called spaces. Within a space, you can create content entries based on types that you define and administrators can establish space access configurations and roles for team members.

Modyo Content has a "headless" architecture which you can use to access content via an API available to both digital channels in Modyo and to external systems and applications.

Thanks to its integrated system of cache and management of HTTP Headers, content can also be hosted on CDNs for greater availability and access speed, regardless of geographic location.

### Main functionalities

- [Spaces](/platform/content/spaces.html) for the organization of contents and teams that manage them.
- [Content types](/platform/content/types.html) to define custom structures.
- [Asset manager](/platform/content/asset-manager.html) for organizing files such as images or videos that are used within the contents.
- [API and SDKs](/platform/content/public-api-reference.html) for access to content repositories, both within and outside of the platform.
