# Content types

![Types](/assets/img/content/types/types.jpg)

Types in Modyo are tools that allow us to structure content templates to build entries, with more than 15 types of fields.

With types, you can avoid having to build a piece of content in the same format many times. You can establish a predetermined style that will allow you to optimize time and promote consistency.

## About the Interface

In the Types section of a space, you can find a green **+ New** button at the top you can click to create a new Type.

Just above the type list on the left, you can use the Type search bar to find any word you are looking for by name.

The list of existing types is sorted by "most recently updated" by default. You can also reorder the types by:

- Name
- UID
- Creation Date
- "Updated on" Date

If you want to enter any Type, you must click on its Name to open the corresponding editor.

## Create a Type

<img src="/assets/img/content/types/new-type.jpg" style="border: 1px solid #EEE; margin-top: 40px" width="450">

To create a Type, click on the green **+ New** button at the top of the screen and give your type a name and a corresponding Unique Identifier (UID).

::: tip Tip
The best practice for UID naming is to name them by their formats, e.g. videos, posts, promotions, etc. This makes it easier for users know what types of content they're working with, and avoid creating redundant types within a space.
:::

In the creation interface, you can see an empty template at the center of your screen, while on the right side, you can see a table with three tabs.

- Add fields
- Field configuration
- Configuration

This interface is where we populate our types with the correct fields we need based on our content requirements.

## Fields

::: tip Tip
The field name is important because this name is how you access the field value through Liquid and JavaScript SDKs. To access the value of a field of an entry through Liquid, use the format <span v-pre>`{{entry["field name"]}}`</span>. For more information go to the [API reference](/platform/content/public-api-reference.html)
:::

All fields require a name, and can optionally be set as required. When a field is required, at the time of creating or modifying an entry, there must be an associated value for that field, otherwise, the entry cannot be saved.

### Single-line text

This field allows you to enter single-line texts. and has the following restrictions:

- **Minimum length**: Allows you to require a minimum text length.
- **Maximum length**: Limit the maximum length of the text entered.
- **Regular expression validation**: Allows you to add a regular expression to validate that the text matches a certain format.


### Rich text

This field translates into a multi-line text WYSIWYG editor that also allows you to modify its HTML code. This field has the following restrictions:

- **Minimum length**: Allows you to require a minimum text length.
- **Maximum length**: Limit the maximum length of the text entered.

- **Minimum length**: Allows you to require a minimum integer value.
- **Maximum length**: Limit a maximum integer value.

### Decimal

This field allows you to add a decimal number that must be by default between `-65325` and `+65325`. However, it can be bounded using the restrictions:

- **Minimum length**: Allows you to require a minimum decimal value.
- **Maximum length**: Limit a maximum decimal value.

Allows you to add a field in which you can select a geographic address, according to the Google Maps fields, or if you do not have a Google _API key_, it will allow you to enter the name, latitude, longitude and five geopolitical location limitations by hand.

:::warning Attention
For location maps to work properly with the Google API Key configured in your account, the key must have permissions to access to:

* Maps JavaScript API
* Places API
* Geocoding API
:::

### Asset

This field allows you to attach a single file to the entry using the file manager.

### Asset List

This field allows you to attach multiple files to the entry using the file manager.

### Content (links to one)

This field allows you to link an entry to another entry that is already created and published within the same space. This field has the following restrictions:

- **Restrict type**: Allows you to select a default type so that the entries that can be selected as a link are only of the selected type.

### Content List (links to many)

This field allows you to link many entries in the space to another entry. This field has the following restrictions:

- **Restrict type**: Allows you to select a default type so that the entries that can be selected as a link are only of the selected type.

## Settings

In this tab, you can see the name of the type, along with its UID. The UID is important as it will be what the type is called from through the Liquid SDK, Javascript and API. Below you will see a button that can be in 2 states:

- **Reindex type**: Allows you to reindex the model if you encountered a problem with your public API.
- **Cancel reindexation**: If there is already a reindexation in progress, you can cancel the process by clicking on this button.

::: warning Warning
When you reindex any of your types, the model that was previously reindexed will remain available until the new reindex is complete. At the end of the new reindexation, the old index will be overwritten with the new index.
:::

::: warning Warning
Note that depending on the [cache settings you have in your space](/platform/content/spaces.html#cache), you may not see the changes immediately after you have finished reindexing.
