# Modyo Insights with Data Studio

Data visualization is important in making data and analysis a central part of business decisions, systems, processes and overall culture. It allows trends and patterns to be more easily seen and facilitates communication of data for decision-making.

Data Studio is Google’s reporting solution that allows you to easily create custom visualizations of your data. To make things even easier, we’ve created Data Studio templates that you can connect to your data sources out of the box.

This guide will walk you through the simple steps to copy a Data Studio reporting template and connect your own data sources so you can analyze the performance of your digital channels and gain insights from your data. 

After walking through this example, you’ll be able to apply the same steps for other Data Studio report templates.

### Connect your data to a Data Studio template

The templates gallery can be found in the Modyo platform under Insights > Data studio.

You should be signed into a Google account in your browser to copy the templates. For this example you should also have access to your site’s Google Analytics and/or Google Search Console accounts.

Steps to connect your data to a Google Data Studio template:


1. Choose the corresponding data studio template

    For this guide we'll be using the Google Analytics + Search Console template. This template is designed to give you a general overview on metrics related to acquisition, behavior, conversions & SEO of your digital channels.

    Copy the report by clicking on this icon in the upper right corner:
