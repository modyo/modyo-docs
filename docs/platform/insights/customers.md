### Customers

Similar to how the Digital Factory provides direct statistics of our team members' activities, Customers gives us a global overview of what our customers are doing in the platform, as well as the behavior of the content that reaches them.

The available filters are:

- Date range
- Targets
- Site

**Active users**: Total users with two or more activity records in the selected period.

**Activity**: Corresponds to the total login count, form responses, open emails, emails notified as spam, and open notifications.

**Logins**: Total count of all user logins.

**Signups**: Total count of all user signups.

### Engagement

Finally, engagement shows the percentage of active users on the site (in the selected period), compared to the total number of users, vizualized through a donut chart.
