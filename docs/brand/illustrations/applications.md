# Applications

Illustrations make ideas more accessible. Like words, illustrations tell stories and represent our brand efficiently and clearly. 
It is very important that illustrations are used correctly and never detract from communication.
In marketing, illustrations are used as a support and communication element generally in websites, service sites, presentations, email, graphics, in social media and campaigns.


## Incorrect Usage
"Hero" images cannot be used as icons and vice versa.

<table>
<tr>
<td style="width:50%;">
<img src="/assets/img/brand/incorrect_illustration_1.png" alt="Hero as Icon">
</td>
<td style="width:50%;">
<img src="/assets/img/brand/incorrect_illustration_2.png" alt="Icon as Hero">
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="dont">Do not use an icon as a hero.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="dont">Do not use a hero as an icon.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width:50%;">
<img src="/assets/img/brand/incorrect_illustration_3.png" alt="Icon as Hero">
</td>
<td style="width:50%;">
<img src="/assets/img/brand/incorrect_illustration_4.png" alt="Hero as Icon">
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p class="dont">Do not place text over the illustrations.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="dont">Margin of less than 1 cm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Exclusion Zone
An adequate margin of at least 28 px/1 cm should be respected around the entire image in both horizontal and vertical dimensions.

<img src="/assets/img/brand/distance_h.svg" alt="Horizontal">
<img src="/assets/img/brand/distance_v.svg" alt="Vertical">										



## Improper Use
Illustrations should preferably be used with a white background. If this is not possible, keep the white inside illustrated figures. Especially on faces and hands.
