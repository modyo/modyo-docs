| Save           | Brokers don't always have all the data at hand. This option helps generate draft policies without losing the current policy issuance process.                                                      |
| Effective Date | Your broker can filter directly by Effective Date and Property type. This saves time by integrating this section with the information collected in the Quote widget. |
| Summary        | This section presents a summary of the quote before generating it to validate coverage, deductibles, and offers the option of changing the premium percentage selected for the quote.                               |
