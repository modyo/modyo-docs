# Summary

The Account Summary widget allows you to review detailed information of your financial products, with which you can make basic payments and transfers, or navigate to other widgets to complete more transactions.

#### Installation:

```bash
modyo-cli get modyo-widgets-retail-summary
```

[Open in new tab](https://widgets.modyo.com/retail/summary)

<iframe id="widgetFrame" src="https://widgets.modyo.com/retail/summary" width="100%"  frameBorder="0" style="min-height:800px;overflow:auto;margin-top:20px;"/>

The Account Summary presents a customer's financial state within the different products they have with the financial institution (Accounts and Credit Cards).

Each summary presents financial information for a specific product both numerically and graphically.

#### Checking Account

The Checking Account section allows you to see an overview of the available balance amounts and gives you access to transactions such as transfers and movements.
