# Welcome to Modyo

Welcome to the documentation of the Modyo. We hope to cover here all the relevant points of the platform, such as the description of the interfaces, publicizing good practices when interacting with the platform, providing examples of use, among other topics.

We have designed the Modyo documentation to be navigated as a guide (from start to finish) or resolve a specific query. The contents within the documentation are interrelated to each other in order to facilitate the understanding of these.
