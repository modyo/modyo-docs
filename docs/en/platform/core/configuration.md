# Configuration

In this section, you can customize your account and the platform according to your needs.

## General

The general options for a Modyo Platform account are:

* **Account name**: Name with which you identify your Modyo account.
* **Account URL**: This is the subdomain that represents your account. If you decide to modify it, make sure that all users are informed of the new URL. Once the change is saved, Modyo will redirect you to the account login.
* **Default site**: If you have more than one site, this option allows you to redirect traffic from the base domain to a specific site.
* **Permanent Redirection**: Uses a 301 status redirect.
* **Default language**: Select the default language of the platform. Existing users can change their language preference in their profile settings.
* **Time Zone**: Defines the schedule for the entire platform. This will be the default time zone for new sites and email campaigns.

:::tip Tip
If the time zone you choose is subject to time changes, these will be automatically reflected when the time changes in the selected zone or country.
:::

* **Modyo Platform version**: Current version of the platform. You can find it in the source of the page, under the meta data `<meta name="modyo-version" content="stable (build 2ee6170, 20220309120810)">`. To view the source, right click on any element on the page and select **View Source Page**.

### Visualization

* **Don't show the first steps page**: Enabling this option hides the first steps button for all users.
* **Account logo and favicon**: Personalize the platform by uploading a logo and favicon for all users. These elements will also be used on default pages and sites.
* **Google API key**: The API key used to connect the Google Maps API to the location-type fields in the Content module.
