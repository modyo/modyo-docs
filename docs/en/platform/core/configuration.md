# Configuration

Customize your account and the rest of the platform according to your needs.

## General

These are the general options for an account on Modyo Platform:

* **Account Name**: This is the name by which you identify this account on the Modyo platform.
* **Account URL**: Choose the sub-domain that represents the account. If you change it, make sure all users know the new URL. After saving you will be redirected to the account login.
* **Default site**: If there is one or more sites, with this option you can redirect traffic from the base domain to this site.
* **Permanent Redirection**: Uses a 301 status redirect.
* **Default language**: Choose the default platform language. Existing users can modify the language from the user settings.
* **Time Zone**: Define the schedule for the entire platform. For example, this will be the default time zone for new sites or email campaigns.
* **Modyo Platform Version**: The current version of the platform can be found within the source of the page, under the meta data `<meta name="modyo-version" content="stable (build 2ee6170, 20220309120810)">`. To view the source, right-click on any element on the page and select **View Source Page**. 

### Visualization
