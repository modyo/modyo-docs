# Configuration

Customize your account and the rest of the platform according to your needs.

## General

These are the general options for an account on Modyo Platform:

* **Account Name**: This is the name by which you identify this account on the Modyo platform.
* **Account URL**: Choose the sub-domain that represents the account. If you change it, make sure all users know the new URL. After saving you will be redirected to the account login.
* **Default site**: If there is one or more sites, with this option you can redirect traffic from the base domain to this site.
* **Permanent Redirection**: Uses a 301 status redirect.
* **Default language**: Choose the language of the platform by default. Existing users can modify the language from the user settings.
* **Timezone**: Define the time zone for the entire platform. For example, this will be the default time zone for new sites or email campaigns.
* **Modyo Platform Version**: The current version of the platform can be found within the source of the page, under the meta data `<meta name="modyo-version" content="stable (build 2ee6170, 20220309120810)">`. To view the source, right-click on any element on the page and select **View Source Page**. 

### Visualization

* **Do not show the first steps page**: Turning on this option will hide the first steps button for all users.
* **Account logo and favicon**: Customize your platform by uploading a logo and favicon for all users. This will also be used by default in new pages and sites.
* **Google API key**: The API key used to connect the Google Maps API to the location-type fields in the Content module.
