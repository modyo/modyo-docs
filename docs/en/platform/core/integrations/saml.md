### SAML

In order to integrate a login with SAML in Modyo, you will need the following information from your identity provider:

- Service name
- Issuer
- Identity Provider Service URL
- Identity Service Provider URL Parameters
- Identity Provider Certificate
- Signing the identity provider's certificate
- Format of the name identification
- Service callback URL: By default this URL is `account_url/admin/auth/saml/callback`
- Logo: As in LDAP, this image will be displayed as the service logo next to the service name in the login form.
