- Identity Provider Service URL
- Identity Service Provider URL Parameters
- Identity Provider Certificate
- Signing the identity provider's certificate
- Format of the name identification
- URL de callback del servicio: Service callback URL: By default this URL is `account_url/admin/auth/saml/callback`
- Logo: As in LDAP, this image will be displayed as the service logo next to the service name in the login form.
