### LDAP

In order to integrate an LDAP login into Modyo, you'll need the following information from your identity provider:

- **Service Name**: It will be displayed under the service login icon or logo.
- **Host**: Address where the LDAP login service is available
- **Port**: Port with which Modyo and your LDAP identification service must be communicated.
- **Base**: Search base, composed of multiple objects separated by commas.
- **UID**: The name of the field used by the LDAP service to identify users as a unique attribute.
- **Bind DN**: Default credentials.
- **Password**
- **Method**: Authentication method with the LDAP identity service.
- **Logo**: Not required, but if you want it to appear next to the service name, for example, your company logo, you can upload an image in this field.
