### LDAP

In order to integrate a login with LDAP in Modyo, you will need the following information from your identity provider:

- **Service name**: It will be displayed under the service login icon or logo.
- **Host**: Address in which the LDAP login service is available
- **Port**: Port with which Modyo and your LDAP identification service should communicate.
- **Base**: Search base, consisting of multiple objects separated by commas.
- **UID**: Name of the field used by the LDAP service to identify users as a unique attribute.
- **Bind DN**: Default credentials.
- **Password**
- **Method**: Authentication method with the LDAP identity service.
- **Logo**: It is not required, but if you want it to appear next to the name of the service (for example, the logo of your company), you can upload an image in this field.
