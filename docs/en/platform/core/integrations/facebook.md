### Facebook

To be able to integrate with Facebook, you must have:

- API Key
- Secret application code

You can obtain these by creating a Facebook application with login permissions. You can learn more about how to create and configure a Facebook application in the [Official Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/).
