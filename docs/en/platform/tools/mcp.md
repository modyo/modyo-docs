# Modyo MCP

An MCP commonly refers to the Model Context Protocol, an open standard for secure and bidirectional communication between artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as large language models (LLM), and external tools or data sources.

Modyo's MCP server allows interaction with the platform and its elements through agents that receive and process information using natural language.

:::info Coming Soon
We will soon have the documentation for this MCP Server available.
