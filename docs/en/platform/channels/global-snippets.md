# Global snippets

A snippet is a reusable piece of code that modularizes and breaks down complex functionalities into simpler parts. Global snippets are dynamically rendered when the page loads.

Global snippets in Modyo allow you to share code between your different web applications.

:::tip Tip
A change in a global snippet affects all web applications where it is used. Therefore, only users with an administrator role can access global snippets.

In the snippet editing view, you can create and manage your global snippets. The top bar offers the following options:

- **Differences**: Allows you to compare changes between multiple versions of a snippet, select versions to compare, and reset or rollback to previous versions.
- **Other actions**:
    - **Archive**: To archive a snippet, you must first publish it.
    - - **Delete**: To delete a snippet, you must first archive it.
- **Save**: Once your snippet is saved, this button changes status to **publish**.

The following sections are above the work area:

- Media
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Snippets: List of previously created snippets.
- Changes: List of previously saved versions.
