# Global snippets

A snippet is a small piece of reusable code. Snippets are useful for modularizing and reusing functions, breaking down complex functionality into simpler parts. In addition, they are dynamically rendered when the page loads.

Global snippets in Modyo allow you to share code between your different web applications.

:::tip Tip
A change in a global snippet affects all the web applications where it is being used, therefore only users with an administrator role can access the global snippets.

In the snippet editing view, you can create and manage your global snippets. In the top bar, you have the following options:

- **Differences:** Allows you to compare changes between multiple versions of a snippet. You can select the versions to compare and reset or rollback to previous versions.
- **Other actions:**
    - Archive: To archive a snippet you must first publish it.
    - Delete: To delete a snippet you must first archive it.
- **Save:** Once you've saved your snippet, this button changes status to **publish**.

The sections that can be found above the work area are:

- Media
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Snippets: List of previously created snippets.
- Changes: List of previously saved versions.
