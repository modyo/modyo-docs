## Structure

**Modyo** also allows you to manage an ecommerce easily, organizing and centralizing orders, as well as simplifying the insertion of payment methods.

For this, there are two options that can be viewed from the same sidebar:

## Commerce Settings

The configuration will allow the commerce to be shaped in all technical aspects, allowing you to adjust defaults and standardize them throughout the site

### General

In this section we will be able to configure general data that give life to commerce, such as currency format.

In addition, it is allowed to activate the sending of an automatic email when the user pays their order, in the form of a receipt.

For this receipt, it is essential to adapt it to commerce, so it is crucial that the code implemented as a template is correctly aligned with the user's order data that the platform will automatically write.

### Payment methods

**Modyo** allows you to insert multiple payment methods, which can make the operation of any company and customer more convenient.

Currently, the payment methods supported by Modyo are:

- Oneclick
- Webpay
- Khipu
- PayU
- PayU PSE
- TigoMoney
- PayMe
- Credomatic
- Bancard

Remember that for each of these payment methods, you need permissions and credentials to operate. Contact the representatives of each company to obtain them.
