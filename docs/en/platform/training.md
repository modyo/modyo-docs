Modyo has the following main modules, which you will know in your training process:
- [**Modyo Content:**](/en/platform/content) Headless architecture application that allows the creation of content spaces that you can consume through an API both inside and outside of Modyo. Among the main concepts are: spaces, types, entries, file manager, team review, among others.

- [**Modyo Customers:**](/en/platform/customers) An application that enables user authentication to sites in Modyo, either through its internal account logging system or your enterprise integrations to Single Sign On (SSO) systems. Among the main concepts are: users, segments, forms, messaging (campaigns and notifications), personalization, among others.
- [**Modyo Insights:**](/en/platform/insights) Application specialized in the representation of statistical data from both the users of your sites and the team that creates content and digital channels.

#### Tutorials
The [tutorials] (https://help.modyo.com/es/collections/4032221-tutoriales) are the easiest way to get started on the Modyo Platform. You only need a [testing environment] (/en/platform/training.html #ambiente -de-tests) and some time to learn the fundamental concepts step by step.
We recommend that you do the tutorials in order, following all the steps presented in them.

#### Learning Paths
Modyo has different [Learning Paths](https://help.modyo.com/en/articles/6928873-learning-how-to-use-modyo) for customers and business partners. They consist of more dynamic alternatives to learn how to use our tools at your own pace.

Take the courses you need according to your needs according to the role you play, or take them all to become a true Modyo specialist. The only requirement to start our Learning Paths is an environment.


#### Test environment
To understand how the Modyo Platform works, it is very important that you can have access to all the features we provide. To do this, you will have access to create a temporary account where you can implement an example project to learn more about the platform.

To create the test account, you must go to the [following link](https://platform.modyo.cloud/try) and complete the form by entering your details and those of your organization.

You will automatically be assigned the role of account administrator, which will grant you the permissions to invite other users on your team to the platform.

This environment will be available for a limited period of time. Once the deadline has expired, the account will be automatically canceled. If you require an extension of the indicated period, you must request it to the email [success@modyo.com](mailto: success@modyo.com), indicating the additional time you need.
