#### Tutorials
The [tutorials](https://help.modyo.com/es/collections/4032221-tutoriales) are the easiest way to get started on the Modyo Platform. Only a [test environment](/en/platform/training.html#ambiente-de-pruebas) and time are required to learn the fundamental concepts step by step.
It is recommended to follow the tutorials in order, completing all the steps presented in them.

#### Learning Paths
Modyo has different [Learning Paths](https://help.modyo.com/es/articles/6928873-como-aprender-a-usar-modyo) for clients and business partners. They consist of more dynamic alternatives to learn how to use our tools at your own pace.

Take the courses you need according to your role or take them all to become a Modyo specialist. The only requirement to start our Learning Paths is an environment.


#### Test environment
To understand how the Modyo Platform works, it is important to have access to all the functionalities we provide. To do this, you will have access to create a temporary account where you can implement an example project to learn more about the platform in depth.

To create the test account, you must go to the [following link](https://platform.modyo.cloud/try) and complete the form with your data and that of your organization.

Automatically, you will be assigned the role of account administrator, which will grant you permissions to invite other users from your team to the platform.

This environment will be available for a limited period of time. Once the deadline expires, the account will be automatically deleted. If an extension is required, you must request it to the email [success@modyo.com](mailto:success@modyo.com), indicating the additional time needed.
