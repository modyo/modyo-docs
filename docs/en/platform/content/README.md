**Modyo Content** has a Headless architecture that allows content to be consumed via an HTTP API from channels defined in **Modyo Channels** and external systems or applications.

Thanks to its integrated system of cache and management of HTTP Headers, content can also be hosted on CDNs for greater availability and access speed, regardless of geographic location.

### Main features

- [Spaces](/en/platform/content/spaces.html) for the organization of contents and teams that manage them.
- [Content types](/en/platform/content/types.html) to define custom structures.
- [Asset manager](/en/platform/content/asset-manager.html) for organizing files such as images or videos that are used within the contents.
- [API and SDKs](/en/platform/content/public-api-reference.html) for access to content repositories, both within and outside of the platform.
