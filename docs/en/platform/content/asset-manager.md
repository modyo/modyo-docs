# Asset Manager

An organization needs to have a platform that allows them to organize and manage their required files and content.

Modyo allows you to upload, review, and edit files within the same platform, through the Asset Manager tool. This can be accessed from your Spaces, Sites, or in the side menu within Content. 

The only requirement is that the files must be within the size limits. The limits are:

- **Images:** 6 MB
- **Videos:** 10 MB
- **Audios:** 10 MB
- **Files: ** 10 MB

The valid file types are:

- **Images: ** apng avif bmp gif ico jpeg jpg png tif tiff webp
- **Videos: ** av avi f4v flv mkv mov mp4 mpeg webm wmv
- **Audios: ** 3gp aac alac dsd flac mp3 pcm wav m4a ogg wma
- **Files: ** 7z ai apk css csv doc docx fon ico iso jar js msi ods odt otf pdf ppt pptx rar rss rtf scss tar tex ttf txt vcf wdp xhtml xls xlsm xlsx xml zip one ecf pub xps json svg woff woff2 ics


## About the interface

This interface shows you a list of all the files that exist within the platform.

In the upper right part of the screen you can see the percentage of space used corresponding to the total allocated for the account and the button to upload new files.

The list has three types of filters that will help you find a file:

**Extensions: ** With this filter you can see all the files of the same type found within the platform (the list is made up of the types of files that have been uploaded to the platform).

**Tags: ** This filter allows you to show all the files associated with a tag that are found within the platform.

:::tip Tip
If you want to add a tag to a file or group of files, you can do so by directly editing the file or by using the bulk actions that appear at the bottom left of the list. 

If you select one or more checkboxes that are on your screen, the button will only assign labels to those files that you have marked.
:::

**Search bar: ** With the search bar, the Manager will show you all the files that have a word or content that is found within the metadata of the file. In this case, it also includes searching for your specific extension, tag, name or user who uploaded it.

:::tip Tip
Modyo displays 30 files at a time, and this value cannot be updated.
:::

Each file listed in the main view shows the following information and attributes:

**Preview: ** If the platform identifies that the file is an image, you can see a small thumbnail of it. If it isn't, this space will appear blank.

**Name: ** Name of the file with the extension included. The order is in alphabetical order.

**Type: ** File type and file extension. The sorting is alphabetically first by type and then by the letter of the extension name.

**Size: ** Size in kilobytes of the file.

**Created on: ** Date of upload or creation within the platform, regardless of whether the file was created on a different date in another service.

**Author: ** Name of the user who uploaded the file, as long as the user has a name assigned to it.

The lower right corner lists the pagination of all your account files.


## File Properties
You can upload any file type to the platform, without no filetype exclusions.

However, the platform recognizes and classifies known file types by their extensions and applies their type to the list.

To access the properties of a file, click on its name to open a modal where you can edit the file's properties.

## Edit a file
You can find and/or edit the following in the file properties editor:

**File URL: ** Shows the public URL of the file. You can copy it to your clipboard by clicking on the side icon.

**Liquid Tag: ** Shows the Liquid tag from the file, to be used within the contents of the platform.

:::warning Warning
Neither the URL nor the Liquid Tag is possible to change through Modyo.
:::

**Title: ** Shows the title of the file. This section is different from the name of the file, which cannot be changed.

**Alternative text:** Shows the ```alt text``` of the element. (Only applies to images and videos).

**Description: ** Description of the item. It's good practice to write a short text that references the image.

**Tags: ** Shows the tags associated with the file, by clicking on the box you can search and add more tags. In turn, you can click on the X of the existing tags to remove the association with the file.

<hr style="margin: 40px 0;" />

To save the modification of the data, it is necessary to click on the **Update Information** button located in the lower right part of the window.

If the data is modified but the button is not clicked to be saved, these modifications will be lost.

If you want to close the window and return to the Manager interface, click on the **Close** button, located at the bottom of the screen.

## Upload an image again

If you want to upload a file again, keeping the name and the original link, click on the icon to upload the file found in the window **Update Information**. Thus, it will display a new window where you can select a new file.

## Edit an image

To facilitate the handling of images within the platform, **Modyo includes an image editor** that allows you to make changes to your images.

One of the changes you can make is to edit the image measurements. To do this, click on the **pencil** icon found in the "Update information" window.

This opens a window with two views that display the original image and a preview of the edited image.

On the left side of the image editor are three options to edit the image size:

- ** 16:9: ** Edit the image in a 16:9 ratio.
- **Square: ** Edit the image to the size of a square.
- **Free: ** Edit the image to a free size in pixels that you can change at the bottom of the screen.

The left side displays the original size of the image and the size in pixels of the crop edit.

:::tip Tip
There are two ways to change the view and cut the image with the cursor:

- **Zoom:** Use the mouse scroll to zoom in.
- **Move background**: Double click outside the clipping area and drag the background.
:::

After cropping an image, if you want to restore it to its original dimensions, you can return to the "Update information" window and select the **Restore Original** button, which returns the image to its original state. However, restoring an image causes you to lose the cropped version.

## Delete a file

To delete a file, click on the Delete icon, located in the upper right corner of the image preview in the "Update information" window.

:::warning Warning
This action is irreversible, and any content using this file will display a broken link.
:::

## Upload a file

There are two ways to upload a file for use in **Modyo**. One of them is through the same section from which you work and another is through the Asset Manager, which gives you the option of taking any material from the local disk to upload it to the platform.

To upload the file, click **Add**.

This action opens a new window that allows you to upload files in two ways:

- **Drag & Drop: ** Drag from your computer's file browser to the window
- **Traditional way: ** Through the browser, clicking and selecting the files

:::warning Warning
You can upload a maximum of 10 files at a time. If you need to upload more, do so in batches.
