# Asset Manager

This space allows you to upload, organize and manage your files in a simple and efficient way.

- In `Modyo 9` this space is called **File Manager**: When migrating to Modyo 10 all assets are preserved, and you can choose in advance which space to move them to.

- Starting with `Modyo 10` this space is called **Media**: Here (unlike the File Manager in Modyo 9), image editing and deleting permissions are carried out through groups. This way, a group can have permissions to view and use assets, but it can't modify or delete them.

You can upload different types of media to this space, considering the following size restrictions per file:


- **Images:** 6 MB
- **Videos:** 10 MB
- **Audios:** 10 MB
- **Files:** 10 MB

The allowed file types are:
- **Images: ** apng, avif, bmp, gif, ico, jpeg, jpg, png, tif, tiff, webp
- **Videos: ** av, avi, f4v, flv, mkv, mov, mp4, mpeg, webm, wmv
- **Audios: ** 3gp, aac, alac, dsd, flac, mp3, pcm, wav, m4a, ogg, wma
- **Files: ** 7z, ai, apk, css, csv, doc, docx, fon, ico, iso, jar, js, msi, ods, odt, otf, pdf, ppt, pptx, rar, rss, rtf, scss, tar, tex, ttf, txt, vcf, wdp, xhtml, xls, xlsm, xlsx, xml, zip, one, ecf, pub, xps, json, svg, woff, woff2, ics



## About the interface

The interface shows you a list of all the files that exist within the platform.

In the upper right part of the screen you can see the percentage of used space corresponding to the total allocated for the account and the button to upload new files.

Modyo displays 30 files per page. At the bottom you can navigate between the file pages.

You can filter the content by:
- **Extensions: ** Filter by file type.
- **Author: ** Filter by username who uploaded the content.
- **Tags: ** Shows all the files associated with a tag.
- **Search bar: ** Type a word to display files that contain that word in their name or metadata.

Labels allow you to organize and group your files. To modify the tags of more than one file, select the files you want and click on the **Add or Remove Tags** button that appears at the bottom of the list.

In this view, the columns are:
- **Preview: ** If the platform identifies that the file is an image, you can view a thumbnail image of the file. If it isn't, the space appears blank.
- **Name: ** Name of the file and its extension. The order is alphabetical.
- **Type: ** File type and extension. The sorting is alphabetical, first by type and then by the name of the extension.
- **Size:** Size in kilobytes of the file.
- **Created on: ** Date of upload or creation within the platform, regardless of whether the file was created on a different date on another service.
- **Author: ** Name of the user who uploaded the file, only when the user is assigned a name.
