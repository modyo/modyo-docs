# What's new in Modyo?

Modyo Cloud and Modyo Enterprise Cloud version 9 are the latest versions of the platform and represent a significant evolution in performance, modularity, availability, and functionalities to improve the control and management of the digital customer experience.

This new version of the platform includes the following improvements and outstanding functionalities:

### New simplified interface

Simplified and cleaner user interface, with the possibility of customizing the Modyo logo according to the client.

### Content application

Allows its use in _headless_ mode through its [API and SDKs](/en/platform/content/public-api-reference.html), or decoupled within templates developed in [Liquid](/en/platform/channels/liquid-markup.html).

### File manager

Allows the management of digital assets, including functionalities such as _tag_ management, image resizing, and meta description management. The new file manager is accessible from the Modyo Content application and is integrated into the platform's text and code editors.

### User realms

Multiple end-user realms can be defined and exclusively assigned to different sites and content spaces. This new functionality allows managing end-user databases in a cleaner and separate way, granting differentiated access to managed resources on the platform and reducing the need to manage separate organizations for different types of users.

### Team review

Evolution of the old _workflows_ functionality, which improves the collaboration experience with tools for reviewing and group approving changes. Team review can be configured in different ways between different sites and content spaces.

### New and simplified roles and permissions

The management of roles and permissions for sites and content spaces has been simplified, streamlining your developments. In addition, a user group functionality is incorporated, allowing you to assign roles very simply within the sites and content spaces.

### Separation of users and administrators

Modyo 9.0 improves user management by completely separating frontend users (site visitors, people interacting with your channels) from administrators (users with assigned roles, content managers, channel developers, engineers, etc.). User and administrative login panels are now separate, allowing for independent identity management service integration, and a custom look-and-feel.

### PWA support

Modyo now has native support for Progressive Web Application enablers, which allows improving the experience of your users in intermittent or lost connectivity conditions.

Modyo now has native support for Progressive Web Applications, which allow you to improve the experience of your users by providing digital channels that pre-cache key resources. This makes it possible to instantly load reliable experiences quickly regardless of intermittency or bad network connections, and can be installed by the user without the need for an app store.

### New rich text editor

Modyo now uses the Froala rich text editor. This editor allows you to quickly develop content and paste text from documents while maintaining the format.

### Content Pages

Modyo now changes the way you use content views. An automatic migration will be performed starting from Modyo 9.2 to bring your content views in [Templates](/en/platform/channels/templates.html) to the Pages section. You can create widget or content pages from the same place. To learn more, see [Pages](/en/platform/channels/pages.html).
