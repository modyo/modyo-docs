# Payments
**Payments** is a Modyo Customers module that allows development teams to charge registered users on the site (or authenticated via one of the Single Sign-On systems).

:::tip Latin America
Currently, Payments only allows integration with payment methods in Latin America.

## Structure

**Modyo** also allows you to easily manage an ecommerce, organizing and centralizing orders, as well as simplifying the insertion of payment methods.

For this, there are two options that can be viewed from the same sidebar:

### Commerce Configuration

The configuration will allow you to shape the commerce in all technical aspects, allowing you to adjust default values and standardize them throughout the site.

### General

In this section we can configure the most general data that gives life to the commerce, such as the currency format.

Additionally, you can enable automatic email sending when the user pays for their order, in the form of a receipt.

For this receipt, it is essential to adapt it to the commerce, so it is fundamental that the code implemented as a template is correctly aligned with the user's order data that the platform will automatically write.

## Payment Methods

**Modyo** allows you to insert various payment methods, which can make the operation of any company and customer more comfortable.

Currently, the payment methods compatible with Modyo are:

- Oneclick
- Webpay
- Khipu
- PayU
- PayU PSE
- TigoMoney
- PayMe
- Credomatic
- Bancard

Remember that for each of these payment methods, you need permissions and credentials to operate. Contact the representatives of each company to obtain them.
