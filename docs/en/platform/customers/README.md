# Modyo Customers

Modyo Customers is an application that enables user authentication on Modyo sites, either through its internal account registration system or through enterprise integrations with **Single Sign-On (SSO)** systems.

Once a user is identified, the platform internally manages the business events they perform during their session. Additionally, using the **Segments** functionality, it is possible to customize the user's content and browsing experience.

**Modyo Customers** is a key component for developing digital products on the platform. It also offers an integrated messaging system for authenticated users.

### Main functionalities

- **[User Management](/en/platform/customers/users)**: Implement custom authentication flows using the integrated system or by connecting it with Single Sign-On (SSO) systems.
- **[Precise Segmentation](/en/platform/customers/segments)**: Customize the user experience through the use of dynamic segments.
- **[Dynamic Forms](/en/platform/customers/forms)**: Collect key information from your users.
- **[Messaging](/en/platform/customers/messaging)**: Send notifications and specific email campaigns to maintain an active connection with your users.
