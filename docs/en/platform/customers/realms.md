# Realms

In Modyo, **realms** group users with similar characteristics and share a common configuration. They are especially useful for managing multiple groups of independent sites or creating a testing environment without affecting active users.

Each realm has specific configurations for login, registration, integrations, forms, segments, and messaging.

:::tip Tip
Changes made to a realm will only affect the users of that realm and not those of other realms.

## Overview

The **Overview** section provides a general summary of the key elements of the realm, including:

- **Registered users**: Total number of users registered in the realm.
- **Segments**: Number of created segments.
- **Forms**: All active forms in the realm.
- **Active campaigns**: All ongoing communication campaigns.

You will also find a chronological log of all activities carried out within the realm, making it easier to monitor and analyze interactions.


This section also includes relevant information such as the main configurations of the realm, the sites where it is used, the integrated identity providers, and their corresponding identifiers.

This overview allows you to efficiently manage each realm and understand how it connects with users and other key elements of the platform.
