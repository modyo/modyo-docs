# Events

This section contains a chronological record of user activities and events.

This log is useful for auditing and monitoring tasks, as it provides you with a detailed history of your users' actions.

## About the interface

In the event interface, you can see a list of users who have carried out tasks, what types of tasks, and when they carried them out.

You can filter events by:
- **Date**: Filter by a specific period or select a start and end date.
- **Type**: Filter by type of event, such as unsuccessful login attempt, login or logout, user creation or activation, password reset, and others.
- **User**: Select a specific user or all users in the realm.

Check the box next to one or more users and click on the**Export** button located below the list to download a file in Excel or CSV format with the selected events.
