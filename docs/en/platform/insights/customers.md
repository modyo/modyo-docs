### Customers

Similar to how the Digital Factory provides direct statistics of our team members' activities, Customers gives us a global overview of what our customers are doing in the platform, as well as the behavior of the content that reaches them.

The available filters are:

- Date Range
- Segment
- Site

**Active users**: Total users with two or more activity records in the selected period.

**Activity**: Corresponds to the total login count, form responses, open emails, emails notified as spam, and open notifications.

**Logins**: Total count of all user logins.

**Signups**: Total count of all user signups.

### User activity

In this graph we can see a comparison between two values that represent user actions within Modyo Channels.

You can select any of these values to compare:

- **Activity**: Total of all activity.
- **Active users**: Includes all users who have performed two or more actions in the specified period of time.
- **Email delivered**: Total emails from campaigns that were successfully sent.
- **Email opened**: Total emails opened in campaigns.
- **Email spam report**: Total spam notifications sent by users receiving emails from your campaigns.
- **Form response created**: Total count of all Modyo form responses.
- **Login**: Total count of all user logins.
- **Notification opened**: Total number of times users opened notification messages.

### Recent Campaigns

In this list, you can find both email and notification campaigns.

### Recent Forms

### Engagement

Finally, engagement shows the percentage of active users on the site (in the selected period), compared to the total number of users, visualized through a donut chart.
