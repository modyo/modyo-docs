# Illustrations

Illustrations aim to communicate, convey ideas and feelings while creating an identity for the brand.

They can have different objectives, either as support of a text, narrative of a situation or the symbolism of a concept.

Illustrations are made for use on a dark and white background. It is recommended to use the specified shades in the brand guide.

They can be categorized into three types depending on the level of complexity and the use that is given to them.

## Hero

These are illustrations that tell stories and complex concepts, which are generally represented with metaphors or fantastic and unreal situations. Sometimes these can be literal but they will always be linked to ideas with some complexity, more details and elements.

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 50%;">

</td>
<td style="width: 50%;">

</td>
</tr>

### Spot hero

Spot Heroes are slightly simplified versions of a Hero, both visually and metaphorically. These assets are perfect when you need to impact within a limited space. Generally, the concepts or ideas represented are simple and direct.

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 50%;">
With the presence of metaphor.
</td>
<td style="width: 50%;">
No presence of a metaphor.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Support element

The supporting elements are generally characters or things that, just as their name implies, support texts and graphics, providing humanity and reinforcing Modyo's identity.

In contrast to the hero and the point hero, these elements do not represent a specific idea. They are generally used to direct the gaze and highlight the content without taking away from what is being communicated.

## Color

Illustrations are made up of solid colored shapes with shadows and linear details in vector.

The following colors are used, giving priority to dark blue for shadows and leaving deep green for accents and details.

White is a color that is always used on faces and hands.
