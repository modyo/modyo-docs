# About retail

Widgets are what allow you to create self-contained _micro frontends_ for your sites and applications.

When you enter the **Widgets** section of your site, you will see a list of all the widgets that have been created. In the top bar, you can filter the list of widgets by status, author or tags, or do a text search by the widget name.

In the top right corner you will see a main button **+ New** that will allow you to create a new widget. You will need to type in a name and then enter the edit view of the widget.

In the edit view of the widget, you will see the top action bar, the workspace, and the properties column.
