Widgets are the ones that allow you to create encapsulated _micro frontends_ for your sites and applications.

When you enter the **Widgets** section of your site, you will see a list of all Widgets that have been created. In the top bar you can filter the list of Widgets by status, author or tags, or do a text search by the name of the Widget.

In the upper right corner you will see a main button **+ New** that will allow you to create a new Widget. You will need to enter a name and then enter the widget edit view.

In the widget edit view, you can see the top action bar, workspace, and property column.
