# Support

If you have questions or problems with the experience and integration templates provided by Modyo Dynamic, you can request help directly from the platform using the help action, which can be accessed from the Web administration panel. In the event that more comprehensive assistance is required, a support case must be created.

The creation of support cases is done from the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com). In the event that a timely response is not obtained, each customer can make use of the established scaling protocol.

:::warning Scope of Support
Queries and support requirements only cover the templates and the ways in which they are integrated with the Modyo platform. Amendments and the code as they are developed upon them are excluded. For these cases, Modyo offers professional services for expert support and customer support.
