### Considerations
The Modyo Dynamic subscription has the following considerations:
- The subscription grants access to the design system, experience templates, and integration templates
- The minimum subscription contract period is 1 year
- Once it has expired, the subscription is automatically renewed unless you have explicitly requested its cancellation.
- Once the subscription has been canceled, access to the templates offered as part of the initiative will be lost, but the components previously created from them will continue to work
