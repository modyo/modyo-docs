# Activation

The activation of Dynamic Framework is carried out through a subscription agreement complementary to that of the Modyo Platform.

:::tip Activation
To request the activation of Dynamic Framework, please contact your assigned sales or customer executive.
:::

### Considerations
The Dynamic Framework subscription has the following considerations:
- The subscription grants access to the design system, experience templates, and integration templates.
- The minimum subscription contract period is 1 year.
- Once it has expired, the subscription is automatically renewed unless you have explicitly requested its cancellation.
- Once the subscription is canceled, access to the templates offered as part of the initiative will be lost, but the components previously created from them will continue to work.
