# Dynamic and Bootstrap

## What is Bootstrap?

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is an open-source framework widely used for front-end development of websites and applications. It provides a set of pre-designed tools and components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that facilitate the creation of responsive and consistent user interfaces. Its flexible grid system, UI components (buttons, forms, navigation bars, etc.), and CSS utilities enable developers to quickly build modern and adaptable designs.

## How Dynamic extends Bootstrap

Dynamic Framework is built upon Bootstrap, leveraging its robustness and popularity to offer specific functionalities and components tailored for financial and business experiences. Instead of reinventing the wheel, Dynamic enhances Bootstrap's capabilities in the following ways:

*   **Consistent Styling and Theming**: Dynamic Framework applies a layer of custom CSS styles and variables over Bootstrap, ensuring that all components (both native Bootstrap and Dynamic-specific) maintain a consistent look and feel aligned with Modyo's brand identity. This is crucial for visual uniformity across all experiences.

*   **Sector-Specific Components**: Dynamic Framework introduces additional UI components designed specifically for the needs of the financial and business sectors (e.g., advanced data tables, interactive charts, complex transaction forms). These components are pre-styled and optimized for the Dynamic ecosystem.

*   **Microfrontend Optimization**: By extending Bootstrap, Dynamic Framework facilitates the construction of microfrontends, providing a standardized base that allows development teams to create and deploy components independently, ensuring seamless visual and functional integration.

*   **Solid and Standardized Foundation**: By using Bootstrap as its foundation, Dynamic Framework inherits a well-documented, tested, and community-maintained codebase. This not only accelerates development but also ensures that built experiences are robust, accessible, and compatible with modern web standards.

### Exploring Bootstrap Components

To better understand how Dynamic Framework leverages Bootstrap, we recommend exploring the official Bootstrap documentation and its components:

*   **Design Components**: [Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/), [Forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/overview/), [Navigation Bars](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/), [Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/), [Modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/modal/), [Alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/alerts/), etc.
*   **CSS Utilities**: [Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/), [Colors](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/colors/), [Typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/typography/), etc.
*   **Grid System**: [Layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/)

By understanding Bootstrap's base components, you will be able to appreciate how Dynamic Framework extends and adapts them to create even more powerful and personalized digital experiences.
