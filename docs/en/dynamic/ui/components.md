# Web Components

Web Components are a standard web technology that allows the creation of reusable and customizable components for web applications. Web Components consist of three main technologies: Custom Elements, Shadow DOM and HTML Templates.

The Dynamic Framework Web Components are implemented with Stencil. Stencil is a Web Components compiler that allows the creation of web components using the latest technologies, including TypeScript, JSX, and Virtual DOM. Stencil allows the creation of web components that are highly efficient, customizable, and reusable.

With Stencil, developers can create their own custom web components using familiar syntax based on JSX and TypeScript. Stencil compiles these components in a format that can be used in any modern web application, regardless of the framework used.

In addition, Stencil makes it easy to create accessible components that meets web accessibility standards, meaning that the components are easy to use for all users, including those with disabilities.
