# Components

Web components are autonomous, reusable units of a user interface. They encapsulate not only their structure, such as the HTML elements, their arrangement, and how the data will be presented, but also their style. They define the visual appearance of the component, such as colors, typography and margins, etc. In addition, components also include their behavior or logic, such as the handling of events, the management of states and specific actions.

Components allow you to divide a user interface into smaller, more manageable and reusable pieces, making it easier to develop, maintain and scale an application.

### React

Dynamic Framework implements its web components with [React](https://react.dev/), which not only facilitates their integration into an existing project based on React, but also allows us to take advantage of the extensive ecosystem, community and support that React offers.
