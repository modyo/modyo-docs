# Principles of Design

Dynamic Framework helps designers and developers build Web applications with a pleasant, modern and customizable design, without the effort of writing and maintaining custom code. Dynamic Framework has been designed using recognizable interaction patterns and with a strong focus on the financial industry and its unique problems with respect to experience. The system has been designed with the following principles:
- **Clarity:** Reduce ambiguity, giving users confidence and understanding in using the application.
- **Simplicity:** With our catalog of components and functionalities, it will be much easier to build experiences, focus your efforts on important business decisions.
- **Efficiency:** Workflows that take precedence over the needs considered in common actions in the financial industry.
- **Consistency:** Consistent and familiar interfaces to the end user, allowing applications to be used more intuitively, regardless of the device being used.
- **Aesthetics:** We pay attention to detail to provide users with components, which, in addition to facilitating functionality, delight them with pleasant interfaces.

Dynamic Framework provides a unified user experience and optimized workflows, with a clean interface that allows work teams to deal with the design and logic behind the implementation of each component.


### Figma Kit
The Dynamic Framework Figma Kit is a set of design tools that includes a library of components, styles, and design patterns based on the Dynamic Framework design system. This kit is designed to be used in Figma, a popular cloud-based collaborative design tool.

The Dynamic Framework Figma Kit allows designers to work more efficiently and consistently by providing a collection of predefined components that can be reused in different parts of a web application. In addition, the design styles and patterns defined in the kit ensure visual consistency across the application.

The kit also includes design elements to help designers create high-quality designs quickly and easily. These elements include icons, typography and other visual elements that can be customized and adjusted to the specific needs of each project.
