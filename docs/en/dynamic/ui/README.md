# Design Principles

Dynamic Framework is based on design principles that help create beautiful, modern, and customizable web applications without the need to write and maintain custom code.

Dynamic Framework has been designed using recognizable interaction patterns; oriented to the financial industry and its unique challenges in the user experience.

The design principles in Dynamic Framework are:
- **Clarity: ** Reduce ambiguity and give users confidence and understanding in using the application.
- **Simplicity: ** Facilitate the construction of experiences by providing a catalog of components and functionalities, allowing you to concentrate on crucial business decisions.
- **Efficiency: ** Prioritize workflows that anticipate common needs in the financial industry.
- **Consistency: ** Present consistent and familiar interfaces to end users, regardless of the device they are using, making it easier to intuitively use applications.
- **Aesthetics: ** Provide users with components with attractive interfaces. Prioritizing both functionality and interface design.

Dynamic Framework gives you a unified user experience and streamlined workflows. Its clean interface allows work teams to focus on the design and the logic behind the implementation of each component.

### Figma Kit
The Dynamic Framework Figma Kit is a set of design tools that include a library of components, styles, and design patterns based on the Dynamic Framework design system. It's specifically designed to be used in Figma, a cloud-based collaborative design tool.

This kit allows designers to work more efficiently and consistently by providing a collection of predefined components that they can reuse in different parts of a web application. In addition, the predefined design styles and patterns in the kit ensure that the visual appearance of the application is consistent.

It also includes design elements such as icons and typographies, which help designers create high-quality designs quickly and easily. These visual elements can be customized and adapted according to the specific needs of each project.
