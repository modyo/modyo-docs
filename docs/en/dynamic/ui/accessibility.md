# Accessibility

Accessibility within Dynamic Framework micro frontends is an important aspect to consider to ensure that all people, including those with disabilities, can use and navigate the user interface effectively.

To implement accessibility, the following practices are followed:
- An appropriate semantic structure is used in the HTML code to ensure that assistive technologies, such as screen readers, can correctly interpret information.
- Textual alternatives for images, videos and other multimedia elements are provided so that people with visual disabilities can access information.
- Contrasting colors and legible fonts are used to ensure that information is easily visible and readable.
- Accessibility is tested with specialized tools such as Lighthouse, to identify and correct accessibility problems.

Modyo implements these practices in order to significantly improve accessibility in its micro frontends and make the user interface more inclusive for all people.
