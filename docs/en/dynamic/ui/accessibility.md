# Accessibility

The central objective of the Dynamic Framework is both to simplify the creation of visually appealing financial experiences and to ensure accessibility right out of the box.

To achieve this mission, Dynamic Framework adheres to a series of key practices, which we constantly adjust to optimize our results:

- **Semantic use of HTML:** Dynamic Framework uses HTML5 semantic tags to structure content in a meaningful way. This helps screen readers and other devices understand the organization of the page.
- **Header Tags:** We use header tags (h1 to h6) in a hierarchical and consistent manner. This provides a logical structure and a hierarchy of content, making it easier for users to understand the relationship between different sections.
- **Keyboard and navigation:** We ensure that interactive components, such as drop-down menus and buttons, are accessible using the keyboard. This allows users to navigate and access functionalities without using a mouse.
- **Color contrast:** By default, we follow high contrast guidelines, ensuring that the text is legible and that the interactive elements are clearly distinguishable.
- **ARIA Tags:** To improve the experience for users with disabilities, we use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes that provide additional information for screen readers and assistive technologies.
- **Hidden and alternative content:** We offer classes like `.sr-only` and `.visually-hidden` to visually hide content while remaining accessible to assistive technologies. We also promote the use of alt attributes and alternative text in images, diagrams, videos, illustrations, etc.
- **Visual and keyboard focus:** We ensure that focusable elements, such as buttons and links, have a clear visual focus style. This helps users to know where their current position is as they navigate the page using the keyboard.
- **Form Validation:** We include status and error indicators in our form components to help users with disabilities effectively understand and correct fields.
- **Screen reader compatibility:** We guarantee compatibility with screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA, ensuring that information is properly transmitted to users who rely on these devices.
