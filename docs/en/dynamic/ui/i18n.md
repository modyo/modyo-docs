# Internationalization

Internationalization (i18n) in a micro frontend refers to the adaptation of the application's user interface to different languages and cultures. In other words, the application must be able to display texts and images in different languages.

Within the Dynamic Framework, internationalization is implemented with the following practices:
- An internationalization library is used that allows the management of different languages. Some popular options are react-i18next, ngx-translate, and i18next.
- Text string identifiers are used to identify user interface texts in the source code, rather than using the texts directly in the code. This will allow texts to be translated into different languages without the need to modify the source code.
- Translation files are created for each language that you want to use in the application. These files must contain the translations of the text string identifiers used in the source code.
- The functionality is implemented in the application to change the language of the user interface. This can be done using a language selector or similar functionality.
- Internationalization tests are performed to ensure that the application is displayed correctly in different languages and cultures.

By implementing these practices, Dynamic Framework ensures that the application is easily adaptable to different languages and cultures, which will improve the user experience for people from different countries and regions.
