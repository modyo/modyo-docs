# Dashboard

### Description
The Business Banking Dashboard is an overview of a customer's entire product portfolio, corresponding to savings accounts, checking accounts, credit cards and loans.

It shows data such as available balances, debts and quotas and allows the user to go to specific product details. 

In addition, it has a side panel with the user's pending tasks, such as configuring roles and permissions, adding team members and upcoming deadlines.
