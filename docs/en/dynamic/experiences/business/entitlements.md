# Entitlements

### Description
The list of roles shows the predefined profiles suggested for operating on the business portal. It contains the description of each role and the level of permissions by operation group. Permissions are classified into 3 groups:
- **Portal operation** (rules associated with accessing the portal)
- **Transactional** (rules associated with the operation of transactions that involve movements of money)
- **Non-transactional** (rules associated with transaction operations that do not involve money movements)   

It is also possible to discard the suggested roles and configure roles from scratch.
