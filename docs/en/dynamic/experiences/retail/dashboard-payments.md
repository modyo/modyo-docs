# Dashboard Payments

The Payment Dashboard offers a centralized view of the different obligations that a user has, allowing quick access to make payments. It has a side panel that allows you to see the payments that have been scheduled. 

```bash
modyo-cli get modyo-widget-retail-dashboard-payments
```

This widget uses the `modyo-service-retail` package to connect to the `loan` product repository.
