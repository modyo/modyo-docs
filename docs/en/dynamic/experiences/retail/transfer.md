# Transfer

It allows transfers to be made between the active deposit accounts that a customer has, generating an entry or exit movement in each of the accounts. It also allows you to share the result of the successful transaction by means of an image or a PDF.

```bash
modyo-cli get modyo-widget-retail-transfer
```

The widget is linked to the `modyo-service-retail` package where it connects to the repository of products, transfers and contacts (Mocked)
