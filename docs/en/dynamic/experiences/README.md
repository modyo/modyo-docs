# Dynamic Experiences

**Dynamic Framework** offers you a catalog of digital experiences focused on financial services that allow you to quickly create functional applications.

In this section you will find the complete catalog of financial experiences in the areas of [Retail Banking](/en/dynamic/experiences/retail/dashboard.html) and [Business Banking](/en/dynamic/experiences/business/dashboard.html), as well as instructions for their installation and development in your local environment.


### Benefits of using financial experiences

Financial experiences allow you to accelerate and simplify the development of solutions for the financial industry and digital banking, by offering customizable interactive components. In addition, they offer:

- **User Experience (UX):** Designed to facilitate user interaction.
- **Basic accessibility:** Including appropriate color contrast, use of legible font sizes and semantic structure, among others.
- **Internationalization and localization of texts and currencies: ** The experiences are developed in English and Spanish, and can be customized to other languages, as required. Once deployed in Modyo, the experiences detect the language configured for your site.
- **Validations for forms and dates**.
- **Flat styles for easy customization: ** Through our design system and popular libraries such as [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/).
