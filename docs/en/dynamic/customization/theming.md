# Theming

**Theme customization in Dynamic Framework allows you to adapt the appearance and style of widgets to specific design requirements.**

Explore the basic concepts of theme design, available CSS variables (or tokens) and learn how to create your own theme.

Theme management in Dynamic Framework involves establishing a set of styles that control the visual appearance of widgets throughout the application. This promotes consistency in design elements such as colors, typography, spacing and other visual aspects, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

**Overview of available CSS variables or tokens**

Dynamic Framework, like Bootstrap, uses CSS variables (or tokens) to optimize style customization in user interfaces. This approach offers a powerful and efficient way to maintain a consistent visual language across all applications.

CSS variables act as placeholders for values within stylesheets. You can define a variable once and then reference it multiple times in the code, which reduces redundancy and facilitates style management and updates.

Dynamic Framework provides a comprehensive set of CSS variables that cover a wide range of style aspects, including colors, typography, spacing and more. [You can find a detailed list of these variables in the official Dynamic Framework documentation.](https://dynamicbanking.co/docs/variables-overview)

**Creating a theme in Modyo**

With Dynamic Framework integrated by default into every new Modyo application, creating custom themes is straightforward. Below is how to create your custom theme.

**1\. Prepare your custom CSS**

Before working with theming in Dynamic Framework, make sure you have a custom CSS file ready to house your styles. You can follow Modyo's developer tips on [how to set up a custom CSS file](https://www.modyo.com/resources/community/developer-tips/customize-your-ui-in-modyo-con-modular-css).

### Add HTML components

Once your custom CSS is ready, you can add any HTML component from Modyo's catalog to your application. Let's take this Hero component as an example:

```html
<section class="bg-white py-8 df-hero-component">
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-7 d-lg-flex mb-lg-4 align-items-center">
					<div>
						<span class="badge text-bg-light mb-2">Benefits</span>
						<h2 class="h3 mb-4">Unlock financial freedom with Dynamic Bank</h2>
						<h5 class="fw-normal text-gray-500 mb-3">Power your wealth journey with Dynamic Bank</h5>

						<div class="mt-4">
							<a href="" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg rounded-pill">Request a demo</a>
							<a href="" class="btn btn-link-secondary btn-lg rounded-pill">Request a demo</a>
						</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-5">
				<picture>
					<img class="mw-100 h-100 rounded-3" src="https://cdn.modyo.cloud/uploads/16ceb73d-4b61-4b8e-ad60-d572013ad8ea/original/Frame_33428.png">
				</picture>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</section>
```

Note that we've added a `.df-hero-component` class to the `<section>` tag in our HTML to ensure styles are applied correctly.

### Define custom CSS variables

Now, let's add custom CSS variables to your stylesheet to adapt the appearance of this component:

```css
:root {
	--df-hero-background-color: #f0f0f0;
	--df-hero-font-family: monospace;
	--df-hero-button-background-color: #ff5722;
	--df-hero-button-text-color: #fff;
}
```

### Apply custom styles

Now that CSS variables are available, you can apply them to the component using CSS rules. Add this code to the same stylesheet:

```css
.df-hero-component {
	background-color: var(--df-hero-background-color);
	color: var(--df-hero-text-color);
	font-family: var(--df-hero-font-family);
}

.df-hero-component .btn-primary {
	background-color: var(--df-hero-button-background-color);
	color: var(--df-hero-button-text-color);
}
```

### Continue customizing

To make additional modifications or create more complex themes, simply add additional CSS rules to your custom stylesheet. This approach allows you to maintain full control over the visual presentation of your Modyo applications while leveraging the power and flexibility of Dynamic Framework.

## Creating a Custom Theme for a Widget

While the theme creation section in Modyo covered applying styles throughout your application, theming individual widgets requires a slightly different approach.

Creating a theme for your widgets can help make your application more modular and easier to maintain. Keep in mind that global CSS styles you define could inadvertently affect your individual widget's CSS behavior. In some cases, you may need to employ higher CSS specificity to ensure your styles are applied correctly.

You have two main options for creating themes for your widgets:

- **Global CSS in your application:** Define your theme within your site's main CSS file. This is a straightforward approach, but might require using more specific selectors to target widget elements.

- **Embedded in React CSS:** If your widget is a React application, you can embed the theme directly in its CSS file. This provides a more encapsulated and modular way to design your widget.

Keep in mind that React components in Dynamic Framework have their own set of predefined custom properties. You can leverage these properties to customize the appearance and behavior of your widgets. [Check the component documentation for a detailed list of available properties.](https://dynamicbanking.co/components)

### Example creating a themed component

Suppose you have a React project set up using the Dynamic Framework installation process [detailed in the documentation](https://dynamicframework.dev/docs/getting-started).

- **Navigate to your component:** Open the `src/components/myComponent.tsx` file.
- **Replace the code:** Replace the existing code with the List component:

    ```javascript
    import { DList, DListItem } from '@dynamic-framework/ui-react';

    export default function MyComponent() {
       	const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];
       	return (
       		<div id="my-component">
       			<DList>
       				{items.map((item) => (
       					<DListItem key={item}>{item}</DListItem>
       				))}
       			</DList>
       		</div>
       	);
    }
    ```

Note the addition of the `id="my-component"` attribute to the container div. This will improve CSS specificity for styling.

- **Define your custom variables:** Add the following CSS variables to your `styles/base.css` file (or your site's main CSS file):

    ```css
    :root {
       	--custom-widget-text-color: #fff;
       	--custom-widget-background-color: #4848b7;
    }

    #my-component .list-group-item{
       	color: var(--custom-widget-text-color);
       	background-color: var(--custom-widget-background-color);
    }
    ```

You can create complex custom themes for your widgets by mixing CSS variables, component properties and Bootstrap classes.

Remember that you can always add more CSS rules to your stylesheet to further customize the appearance and behavior of your widget.
