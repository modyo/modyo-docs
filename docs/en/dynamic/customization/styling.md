# Dynamic and Bootstrap

## What is Bootstrap?

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a widely used open-source framework for front-end development of websites and applications. It provides a set of pre-designed tools and components in HTML, CSS and JavaScript that facilitate the creation of responsive and consistent user interfaces. Its flexible grid system, UI components (buttons, forms, navigation bars, etc.) and CSS utilities allow developers to quickly build modern and adaptable designs.

## Dynamic and Bootstrap

Dynamic Framework is built on Bootstrap, leveraging its robustness and popularity to offer specific functionality and components for financial and business experiences. Instead of reinventing the wheel, Dynamic enhances Bootstrap's capabilities in the following ways:

- **Consistent Styling and Theming**: Dynamic Framework applies a layer of custom CSS styles and variables on top of Bootstrap, ensuring that all components (native Bootstrap and Dynamic-specific) maintain a consistent look and feel with Modyo's brand identity. This is crucial for visual uniformity across all experiences.
- **Industry-Specific Components**: Dynamic Framework introduces additional UI components designed specifically for the needs of the financial and business sector (e.g. advanced data tables, interactive charts, complex transaction forms), pre-styled and optimized for the Dynamic ecosystem.
- **Microfrontend Optimization**: By extending Bootstrap, Dynamic Framework facilitates microfrontend construction, providing a standardized foundation that allows development teams to create and deploy components independently, ensuring seamless visual and functional integration.
- **Solid and Standardized Foundation**: By using Bootstrap as a foundation, Dynamic Framework inherits a well-documented, tested and maintained codebase by a large community. This accelerates development and ensures that built experiences are robust, accessible and compatible with modern web standards.

### Exploring Bootstrap components

To better understand how Dynamic Framework leverages Bootstrap, we recommend exploring Bootstrap's official documentation and components:

- **Design Components**: [Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/), [Forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/overview/), [Navigation Bars](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/), [Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/), [Modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/modal/), [Alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/alerts/), etc.
