# Integrations

The Dynamic APIs seek to implement a reference model to integrate Dynamic Widgets with the ecosystem of systems that are part of the financial solutions we seek to adopt.

The Dynamic APIs will be developed based on Modyo Connect, using the Java Spring Boot standard as the base language, which reduces future adaptation and operation efforts thanks to the enormous community that these technologies have.

The Dynamic APIs follow the REST standard and contain a documentation portal based on Swagger or similar for developers, in which the different endpoints and their usage can be explored with examples.
