# Log Registration

Log registration refers to the sequential recording in a file or database of all events or actions that affect a particular process, constituting evidence of the system's behavior.


Modyo Connect implements its log registration using [AWS CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html), which allows for the centralization of logs and thus a unified view of all logs generated by the infrastructure components.


## Steps to Activate

AWS CloudWatch Logs are active by default across all infrastructure managed by Modyo Connect. They are accessed through the service accounts.

It is the responsibility of the user generating the logs to obfuscate the parameters and sensitive information included in the logs.
