# Developer Access

Developer Access is the entry point for utilizing Modyo Connect services. Once enabled, developers can interact with [created repositories](code-repository.html) in the version control system and the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) to activate additional services. Furthermore, developer access grants permissions to access cloud systems, metrics, monitoring, and logs.

When activating developer access, consider the following:
- The GitHub account must have two-factor authentication enabled; otherwise, it will not comply with Modyo's security policy, and access to repositories will be denied.
- GitHub users are added to the repository as "external." Modyo cannot guarantee the security of these accounts, so each client is responsible for ensuring their developers activate additional security measures (e.g., secure passwords, token control).

## Steps to Activate
Create a requirement ticket in the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) stating:
- The developer's GitHub user (create one if you don't have one).
- Name and email of the developer.
- Whether the developer is authorized to request changes to the service components.

:::warning Important
The client is responsible for informing Modyo if they need to remove a developer's access by creating a requirement ticket in the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com).
