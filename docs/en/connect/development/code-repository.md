# Code Repository

Source code repositories enable the management of all aspects of the code lifecycle, including versions, inspections, automations, and collaboration flows among development team members.

Source code repositories are implemented on top of Modyo's GitHub Enterprise service. Additionally, GitHub Security solutions are utilized for dependency inspection, and SonarCloud for Java and JavaScript.


## Steps to Activate
Create a requirement ticket in the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) stating:
- Type of repository: micro frontend, microservice, or intermediary artifact.
- Repository name: Modyo will apply an internal naming standard with prefixes and/or suffixes depending on the repository type.
