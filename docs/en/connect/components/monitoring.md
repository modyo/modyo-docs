# Monitoring

Monitoring is crucial to ensure the efficiency and continuity of cloud applications. Accessing reliable information about system performance allows for better decision-making regarding critical points that require attention.

Modyo Connect includes real-time monitoring capabilities of the health of your infrastructure and applications, generating aggregated metrics in dashboards to determine the overall health of the service.

Modyo Connect is a managed service; most metrics are handled internally by our operations teams. As part of the service, only alerts related to your particular applications (e.g., problems with external services or internal application errors) are escalated to the client.

## Application Metrics

Application metrics monitoring is a type of "white box" monitoring that instruments agents to report the behavior of internal elements of each application. It detects response times of services (e.g., APIs, databases, caching systems), providing a 360Â° view of the application status.

Modyo Connect implements its application metrics monitoring service with [NewRelic APM](https://www.newrelic.com). NewRelic APM captures real-time performance metrics and centralizes them in web-accessible dashboards, highlighting:

- Average response times and percentiles

- Error rate

- [Apdex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex)

- Status of external services or APIs

- Slow traces within the application


### Steps to activate

To activate application monitoring with NewRelic in a microservice, ensure that the Java agent is installed and properly initialized as part of the service, as shown in the following example:


``` Dockerfile

FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk11-openj9:jdk-11.0.10_9_openj9-0.24.0

WORKDIR /usr/app

COPY build/libs/<microservice-name>.jar .

CMD java -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0 -XX:MinRAMPercentage=75.0 -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=75.0 -jar -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2 -javaagent:./newrelic/newrelic.jar -Dnewrelic.environment=$STAGE_NAME <microservice-name>.jar

```

In the example above, the following parameters activate monitoring:


``` Java

-javaagent:./newrelic/newrelic.jar -Dnewrelic.environment=$STAGE_NAME 

```


The $STAGE_NAME variable is used to notify NewRelic the environment configuration to use (production, certification, staging, etc.).



:::tip NewRelic Token
The NewRelic API token, used to import metrics into the service, is automatically injected as part of the microservice environment variables.

:::warning Basic and full users in NewRelic
Accesses granted by Modyo Connect are of the "basic" type and restricted exclusively to the dashboards defined for each service. Modyo does not provide "full" access to any user of the service.
:::


## Infrastructure Metrics

Infrastructure metrics monitoring includes all details about the cloud dependencies configured for the service.


Modyo Connect implements infrastructure monitoring using [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).


### Steps to activate

AWS CloudWatch monitoring is active by default across all infrastructure managed by Modyo Connect. It is accessed through the service accounts.


:::tip Monitoring with NewRelic
The most relevant infrastructure monitoring metrics are sent to NewRelic via [AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html), for centralization and cross-referencing with application metrics.

## Log Registration

Log registration refers to the sequential recording in a file or database of all events or actions that affect a particular process, constituting evidence of the system's behavior.


Modyo Connect implements its log registration using [AWS CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html), which allows for the centralization of logs and thus a unified view of all logs generated by the infrastructure components.


### Steps to activate

AWS CloudWatch Logs are active by default across all infrastructure managed by Modyo Connect. They are accessed through the service accounts.


:::warning Log obfuscation
It is the responsibility of the user generating the logs to obfuscate the parameters and sensitive information included in the logs.
