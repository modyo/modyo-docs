# Support

Modyo's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team operates on 24/7 on-call shifts. Each shift includes primary and secondary engineers, with options to contact customer-appointed technicians or escalate to internal experts as needed.

Support activation is managed through the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) by submitting an incident ticket. If a ticket does not receive a timely response, Modyo establishes a personalized escalation protocol with each customer.
