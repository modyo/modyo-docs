# Support

Modyo's SRE team works on a 24x7 on call system. On each shift there are always primary and secondary (backup) engineers, with the possibility of contacting customer-defined technical contacts or escalating to internal subject matter experts if required.

Support is activated in the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) using an incident ticket. In the event that the ticket does not receive a timely response, an appropriate escalation protocol is defined with each client.
