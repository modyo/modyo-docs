# Support

Modyo's Site Reliability Engineer (SRes) team operates in 24/7 on-call shifts. Each shift includes primary and secondary engineers, with the option of contacting customer-appointed technicians or escalating to internal experts if required.

Support activation is done in the [Modyo Support Center] (https://support.modyo.com) using an incident ticket. In cases where the ticket does not receive a timely response, Modyo establishes a personalized escalation protocol with each customer.
