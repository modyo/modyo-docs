# Support
Modyo's SREs team works on a 24x7 “on call” shift system. At each shift, there are always primary and secondary (backup) engineers, with the possibility of contacting technical contacts defined by the customer or scaling up internal experts on specific topics if required.

Support is activated in the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) using an incident ticket. In the event that the ticket does not receive a timely response, an appropriate escalation protocol is defined with each client.
