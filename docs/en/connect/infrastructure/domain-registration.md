# Domain Registration

Domain registration is the process by which a person or organization acquires a domain name from a registrar. If granted, the applicant gains control of that name and is responsible for its proper use on the Internet. These registrations have a period of validity that can be renewed indefinitely by the registrar. If not renewed, the registration is released for any registrar to initiate the registration process.

Modyo Connect allows the client to request the registration of TLD domains available in the [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) service. Modyo cannot guarantee the availability of the domain selected by the client and will not be able to import domains with TLD extensions that are not compatible with AWS.

## Activation Steps
To request the registration of a domain, a requirement ticket must be created in the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) stating:
- Name of the domain to be registered.
- Alternative names in case the main name is not available.
- Primary and secondary DNS addresses to which the domain should point (if not [managed by Modyo](domain-name-service.html)).

:::tip Domain Transfer
Domains registered by Modyo can be transferred to another registrar if the client requests it (provided the registrar is compatible with the TLDs managed by AWS).
