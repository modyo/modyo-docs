# Mailing/SMS

Modyo Connect offers the email or outgoing SMS messaging service. Microservices that require this functionality can use the Modyo Customers API.

Outgoing emails sent by the Modyo platform API are encrypted and validated following modern security standards. Sending domains require prior validation at the DNS level.

In cases where the Modyo Customers API cannot be used, Modyo may authorize the delivery of direct SMTP credentials or SMS sending APIs, subject to review and approval.

## Activation Steps
To use the Modyo Customers messaging API, a valid access token must be requested from the internal account administrator.

To request direct access to email sending services, a requirement ticket must be created in the [Modyo Support Center](https://support.modyo.com) stating:
- Brief description of the use case.
- Technical and commercial contacts with whom the final approval will be defined.
