# Modyo Resource Units (MRUs)

The Modyo Resource Unit (MRU) is an abstraction for sizing resource and license consumption in Modyo Connect components. MRUs account for all configured environments and are billed monthly. Modyo establishes the number of MRUs for each resource based on an analysis that includes factors such as cloud costs, taxes, operation, and associated licenses, among others.

:::warning Service costs
Each component request may lead to a variation in the total number of MRUs billed. Therefore, some requests will require formal client approval.

## Cost estimation

Modyo assists with cost estimation for service infrastructure running on Modyo Connect. A solution architect from our professional services team will perform an analysis that includes criteria such as:

- Number of microservices required.
- Size of microservice instances, based on estimated traffic volume.
- Authentication requirements (SSO).
- Data persistence.
- Required pre-production environments.
- Required VPN links and access.
