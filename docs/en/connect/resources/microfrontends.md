## Development
Modyo Platform can be extended in functionality through the development of Widgets and Microservices. Widgets can be developed using Modyo's internal tools, such as the Widget Builder, or externally using the Modyo CLI. 
Widgets developed with the CLI will require a code repository and automation pipelines, which generate code that is directly deployed in Modyo Platform. 

::: tip Code Repository
The initial code and structure of the project in the developer's local environment must be backed up in a [code repository](.. /components/development.md#code-repository) provided by the service.
