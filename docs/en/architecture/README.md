# Architecture

In today's digital age, web development has taken a central role in creating software solutions. However, with the increasing complexity and scale of modern web applications, it is increasingly necessary to adopt effective and efficient software architecture patterns to ensure the scalability, maintainability, and effectiveness of our solutions.

This guide seeks to explore the various software architecture patterns that are shaping the way we develop and understand web applications. From modular, component-oriented architecture, to more contemporary approaches such as architecture based on micro frontends, microservices and Domain-Driven Design, we will address each of these patterns in detail, breaking down their principles, advantages, disadvantages and ideal use scenarios, in addition to addressing their implementation with Modyo.

The goal is to provide solid guidance and a reference resource for web developers, software architects, and all interested parties seeking to address the challenges of modern web development, and to take full advantage of software architecture patterns to build robust, scalable, and future-oriented applications.

:::tip High Level Approach
This guide contains high-level patterns and is intended for software architects and technical leaders. For a review of more specific programming patterns, we recommend the book [“Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) by Erich Gamma, Ralph Johnson, Richard Helm and John Vlissides.

## Architectural Patterns

Architecture patterns are tested and recommended solutions to common problems in software design and development. These patterns establish a structure and set of rules for organizing and relating the components of a system, which facilitates software development, maintainability, and scalability. By using architectural patterns, developers can take advantage of established best practices and obtain a structured approach to building high-quality applications. These patterns address concerns such as separation of responsibilities, modularity, code reuse, and data management, among other fundamental aspects in software development. By following these patterns, development teams can create systems that are robust, flexible, and easy to maintain.
