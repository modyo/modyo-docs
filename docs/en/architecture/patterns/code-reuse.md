# Code Reuse

Code reuse is the practice of designing and writing code that can be used in multiple contexts or applications, avoiding the need to create new implementations for each function or application. Its objective is to "write once, use many times".

This practice offers multiple advantages, such as:

- **Efficiency**: Reduces time and effort by avoiding code rewriting.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform behavior of functions in different parts or applications.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitates updating and correcting errors by centralizing the code in a single reusable base.

Code reuse in web application development is achieved through the use of libraries, frameworks, the creation of reusable components, and a code organization that allows for easy referencing and use of its parts in different sections of an application.
