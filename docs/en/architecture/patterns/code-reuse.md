# Code Reuse

Code reuse refers to the practice of writing code that can be used in multiple contexts or applications, rather than having to write new code for each new function or application. The idea is to “write once, use many times”.

This practice can have several advantages, such as:

- **Efficiency**: You can save time and effort by not having to write the same code over and over again.
- **Consistency**: Reusing code can help ensure that certain functions behave consistently across all parts of an application or across multiple applications.
- **Maintainability**: It's easier and faster to update or correct errors in a single reusable code base than in multiple copies of the same code.

There are several ways to reuse code in web application development. This can involve using libraries or frameworks, creating reusable components, or even simply organizing the code so that parts of it can be easily referenced and reused in different parts of an application.


### How do you implement code reuse with Modyo?

There are several alternatives in Modyo for reusing code that don't necessarily involve the use of Web Components. Depending on the type of project being developed, some of these options may include:

- Applying code snippets in Liquid.
- Implementation of shared Widgets on multiple sites.
- Deployment of micro frontends in different Web applications.
- Use of intermediate libraries or repositories.
- Use of Web Components.
- Use of Design Systems.
- Integration of external libraries implemented in various Web sites or applications.
