# Code Reuse

Code reuse is the practice of designing and writing code that can be employed in multiple contexts or applications, thereby avoiding the need to create new implementations for each function or application. Its primary objective is to "write once, use many times."

This practice offers numerous advantages, including:

- **Efficiency**: Reduces development time and effort by eliminating redundant code writing.
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform behavior of functions across different parts of an application or in various applications.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies updates and error corrections by centralizing the code in a single, reusable base.

Code reuse in web application development is achieved through the utilization of libraries, frameworks, the creation of reusable components, and a code organization that facilitates easy referencing and application of its parts across different sections of an application.
