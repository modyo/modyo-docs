# Accessibility

Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and applications in a way that they are accessible and usable by all people, including those with disabilities or limitations. The main goal of web accessibility is to eliminate barriers that prevent people with disabilities from accessing, interacting and fully benefiting from online resources and services.

Web accessibility is based on the principle of universal design, which seeks to create products and environments that are usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their skills or abilities. This involves taking into account the needs of different users, such as people with visual, hearing, motor or cognitive disabilities.

Some key aspects of web accessibility include:

- **Assistive technology compatibility:** Ensure that people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers or special keyboards, can effectively navigate and access content.
- **Semantic tagging:** Use HTML tags correctly to structure and describe content clearly, allowing people with visual or cognitive disabilities to understand the information presented.
- **Contrast and readability:** Ensure that the content has adequate contrast between the text and the background, making it easier to read for people with visual disabilities or difficulties with perception.
- **Ease of navigation and use: ** Design intuitive and navigable interfaces, with controls and interactive elements that are easy to use with both the mouse and the keyboard.
- **Alternatives for non-textual content: ** Providing textual alternatives for non-textual elements, such as images or videos, allowing people with visual or hearing disabilities to understand the content.

Web accessibility is a fundamental aspect to ensure inclusion and equal access to information and online services. Meeting accessibility standards and guidelines, such as those established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), is essential to creating an accessible web and benefiting a wider audience.

### How do you measure how accessible a site is?

Web accessibility is measured using different techniques and evaluations that focus on verifying whether a website or application meets established accessibility standards and guidelines. Some of the most common ways to measure web accessibility include the following:

- **Manual evaluation: ** This consists of manually reviewing the website or application to identify possible accessibility barriers. This involves verifying the structure of the content, the appropriate tags, contrast, navigability, the availability of alternatives for non-textual content, among other key aspects.
- **Automatic evaluation tools: ** There are automated tools that analyze the code and content of a website for accessibility issues. These tools can detect missing or incorrect elements, provide recommendations, and generate reports on the level of accessibility of the site.
- **Testing with real users: ** Involves involving people with disabilities or limitations to test and evaluate the accessibility of the website. Real users can provide valuable feedback on the barriers they encounter when interacting with the site and help identify areas for improvement.
- **Compliance with standards and guidelines: ** It is evaluated if the website complies with established accessibility standards and guidelines, such as the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These guidelines provide specific criteria and recommendations for achieving web accessibility.

It is important to note that web accessibility is an ongoing process and must be done periodically to ensure that it is maintained during the development and updates of the website or application. In addition, it is essential to consider the needs and feedback of users with disabilities, as they are the best judges of the accessibility of the site.

### How do you implement accessibility with Modyo?

How you implement accessibility in Modyo will depend on each type of initiative and the objectives you want to achieve with them, but in general we recommend considering the following criteria:

- Determine the degree of accessibility necessary for the project in question.
- Establish a way to measure accessibility to assess compliance with standards.
- Ensure that you comply with the basic accessibility standards of the Bootstrap framework, which provides guidelines and
  components accessible by default.
- Ensure that media files (such as photos and videos) managed in Modyo Content include descriptions
  suitable alternatives. These descriptions help people with visual disabilities understand the
  multimedia content.
- When embedding media files in a page or widget in Modyo, it is recommended to use the Liquid tag in
  instead of a fixed URL. This ensures that alternative descriptions are represented correctly and can be
  easily updated by the content management team.

By following these criteria, web accessibility is promoted in the development of projects in Modyo, allowing a greater number of users to access and enjoy the online experience in an inclusive manner.
