# Accessibility

Web accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites and applications so that all people, including those with disabilities or limitations, can access and use online resources and services. The main goal of web accessibility is to eliminate barriers that prevent people with disabilities from accessing, interacting and fully benefiting from online resources and services.

Web accessibility is based on the principle of universal design, which seeks to create products and environments that are usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their skills or abilities. This involves considering people with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive disabilities.

Some key aspects of web accessibility include:

- **Assistive technology compatibility: ** Ensure that people using assistive technologies, such as screen readers or special keyboards, can effectively navigate and access content.
- **Semantic tagging:** Use HTML tags correctly to structure and describe content clearly, allowing people with visual or cognitive disabilities to understand the information presented.
- **Contrast and legibility: ** Ensure adequate contrast between text and background to facilitate reading for people with visual disabilities or perception difficulties.
- **Ease of navigation and use: ** Design intuitive and navigable interfaces, with controls and interactive elements, easy to use, both with the mouse and keyboard.
- **Alternatives for non-textual content: ** Provide textual descriptions for images or videos so that people with visual or hearing disabilities understand the content.

Web accessibility is essential for inclusion and equal access to information and online services.

Meeting accessibility standards and guidelines, such as those established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), is essential to creating an accessible web and benefiting a wider audience.


### Web accessibility measurement

Web accessibility is measured using different techniques and evaluations. Some of the most common forms are:

- **Manual evaluation: ** Consists in manually reviewing the website or application to identify possible accessibility barriers. This involves verifying the structure of the content, the correct use of tags, contrast, navigability, and the presence of alternatives for non-textual content, and other key aspects.
- **Automatic evaluation tools: ** Makes use of automated tools that analyze the code and content of a website for accessibility issues. These tools can detect missing or incorrect elements, provide recommendations, and generate reports on the level of accessibility of the site.
- **Testing with real users:** Calls for involving people with disabilities or limitations to test and evaluate the accessibility of the website. Real users can provide valuable feedback on the barriers they encounter when interacting with the site and help identify areas for improvement.
- **Compliance with standards and guidelines: ** Consists in evaluating whether the website complies with established accessibility standards and guidelines, such as the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These guidelines provide specific criteria and recommendations for achieving web accessibility.

Web accessibility is an ongoing process that you must carry out periodically to ensure that a website or application is always accessible to users, especially during development and update phases. In addition, it is essential to consider the needs and feedback of users with disabilities, as they are the ones who can best evaluate the accessibility of the site.


### Accessibility in Modyo

The implementation of accessibility in Modyo depends on each type of initiative and the objectives that you want to achieve with them. However, we recommend following these general criteria:

- Determine the degree of accessibility necessary for the project.
- Establish a method for measuring accessibility and evaluating compliance with standards
- Ensure that you comply with the basic accessibility standards of the Bootstrap framework, which provides guidelines and
  components accessible by default.
- Confirm that media files, such as photos and videos, in Modyo Content include appropriate alternative descriptions to help people with visual disabilities understand multimedia content.
- Use the Liquid language tag instead of a fixed URL when embedding media files in a page or widget in Modyo, to ensure the correct representation of alternative descriptions and to allow easy updates by the content management team.

By following these criteria, you promote web accessibility in the development of projects in Modyo and allow a greater number of users to access and enjoy the online experience in an inclusive way.
